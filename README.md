# pysupmag
Python toolkit for downloading, analyzing and plotting data from SuperMAG

[SuperMAG](http://supermag.jhuapl.edu/)

### To Do:
- ~~get MultifileArray working for numpy arrays~~
- ~~get MultifileArray working for xarray datasets~~
- write DataCollection management functions for collecting aligned data
- write dataset creation functions
- multithreaded downloading for the interpolated data
- generator functions for using data with tensorflow and keras
- make plots

### Planned features
- download data using multiple threads
- select stations, time period, global region, chain
- data in xarray DataSet / DataArray
- save the data as NetCDF / hdf5 / other?
- download movies from website
- make plots similar to website
